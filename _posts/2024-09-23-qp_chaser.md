**Abstract:** Maintaining the visibility of the target is one of the major objectives of aerial tracking missions.
This paper proposes a target-visible trajectory planning pipeline using quadratic programming (QP).
Our approach can handle various tracking settings, including 1) single- and dual-target following and 2) both static and dynamic environments, unlike other works that focus on a single specific setup.
In contrast to other studies that fully trust the predicted trajectory of the target and consider only the visibility of the targetâ€™s center, our pipeline considers error in target path prediction and the entire body of the target to maintain the target visibility robustly. 
First, a prediction module uses a sample-check strategy to quickly calculate the reachable sets of moving objects, which represent the areas their bodies can reach, considering obstacles.
Subsequently, the planning module formulates a single QP problem, considering path topology, to generate a tracking trajectory that maximizes the visibility of the target's reachable set among obstacles.
The performance of the planner is validated in multiple scenarios, through high-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments.
